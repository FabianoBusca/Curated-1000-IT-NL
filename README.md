# Tatoeba Italian-Dutch Sentence Pair Dataset

This repository contains a dataset of sentence pairs in Italian and Dutch, sourced from the Tatoeba Project and curated for linguistic research and educational purposes. The primary focus of the curation process was to enhance the dataset for learning specific linguistic phenomena and ensuring a diverse variety of examples.

## Curation Process

The curation was conducted using the `curator.ipynb` notebook, which applied the following steps:

1. **Selection Criteria**  
   Sentences were chosen to emphasize learning specific linguistic phenomena, such as:
   - **Subject Emission** (common in Italian but not in Dutch).
   - **Reflexive Constructions**.
   - **Negation** (including double negation patterns).
   - **Gendered Nouns and Articles**.
   - **Clitic Pronouns**.
   
2. **Variety**  
   Efforts were made to include sentences from a broad range of contexts, vocabulary, and complexity levels.
